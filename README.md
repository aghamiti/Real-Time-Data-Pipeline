# Real-Time-Data-Pipeline
Task for a Data Hackathon
Real-Time Data Pipeline
Project Overview
This project implements a real-time data pipeline for ingesting, processing, and visualizing streaming data. The primary goal was to tackle a data hackathon challenge where participants were tasked with creating a solution to handle and analyze continuously updated data fetched from an external API.

Features
Continuous Data Ingestion: Fetches data from a live API that updates in real time.
Data Transformation: Cleans and transforms the raw data for downstream use.
Data Storage: Stores processed data in a database for querying and visualization.
Real-Time Visualization: Displays key insights and trends on a dynamic dashboard.
Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle high-frequency updates and large volumes of data.
Architecture
The pipeline consists of the following components:

API Fetcher: A Python script or microservice that continuously fetches data from the source API.
Message Queue: Ensures reliable delivery of fetched data (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ).
Processing Layer: Transforms raw data into usable formats using Python or Spark.
Database: Stores processed data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis).
Visualization Dashboard: Built with tools like Tableau, Grafana, or a custom React app.
